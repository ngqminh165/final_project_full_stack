# Getting Started with Cellaborate Project

This project was run locally in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or run online at [https://cellaborate.herokuapp.com/](https://cellaborate.herokuapp.com/). 

## Run Loccally

1. First, navigate to the project directory: 
###### cd ../Github/final_project_full_stack/final-project
During our working, we add a lot of module. So, in the project directory, need to run the line:

### `npm install`

It will jump in package.json and install all module in it. Next, In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

2. The app will not show all the list, or create the new list because we just only run the font-end. Therefore, to show all the party's lists in the main page and run other features with party's lists. We need to navigate to back-end directory:

###### cd ../Github/final_project_full_stack/final-backend

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run develop`

It will run strapi develop which manage the back-end party's lists. Now you can see all the lists and use all the features of the app. 

## Run Online

The faster way to see our app. Just need to click to the link: [https://cellaborate.herokuapp.com/](https://cellaborate.herokuapp.com/). It included all the font-end and back-end management as well as all features.
